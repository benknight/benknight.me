### What I’m reading now

- _**Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow**_ by Gabrielle Zevin
- _**The Origin of Species**_ by Charles Darwin

---

### 2025

- _**Sum**_ by David Eagleman (B+)

- _**The Miracle of Mindfulness**_ by Thich Nhat Hanh (B - good bedtime read. We should always be in a state of mindfulness which means awareness about what is happening in the present moment. Meditation is a way of practicing mindfulness. The breath is how we can bring ourselves back into awareness. Washing the dishes for the sake of washing the dishes, not rushing to finish. Remaining in a state of awareness even during conversation.)

- _**Breath**_ by James Nestor (B- things everyone should know about breathing which, like the gut, is an easily overlooked cornerstone of health. Basic takeaways: always breathe through your nose, most people breathe too much. 5.5 breaths per minute at 5.5s inhale and exhale. Chewing important for opening the airways. Increasing CO2 tolerance is key for athletic performance. Some parts feel like borderline pseudoscience however, and the book has too much story and narrative that not relevant to the content)

- _**The Coddling of the American Mind**_ by Jonathan Haidt (B – some alternative titles could be "Why Gen Z is so fucked up (social media)" or "How the political left went off the deep end". I skimmed most of it since the ideas it proposed have been widely accepted and disseminated by other podcasters/authors like Mark Manson. The best part is the 3 great untruths which explain a lot of the social media fueled craziness that started happening in Western democracies in the mid 2010s which I definitely felt while living in SF and ultimate pushed me to be more centrist and anti-political. Also one if the reasons it was a relief to move to Southeast Asia where the mind virus hadn't taken hold.)

- _**The Psychology of Money**_ by Morgan Housel (C - an amalgamation of modern personal finance advice and human psychology. If you've read Daniel Kahneman and Ramit Sethi, you've already got the gist of how these two topics intersect. Enjoyable read but didn't learn anything new.)
- _**Four Thousand Weeks**_ by Oliver Burkeman (A — Humanity's futile relationship with time and misunderstanding of it as being a resource we have. We "are" time. Failure to use our time well is rooted in fear of confronting our limitations/our death. Distractions give us a way out. They are not the cause, just where we go. Nowadays distractions are readily available via technology, but urge to avoid reality is universal human nature. Commitment as a strategy to spend time on what matters. Industrial revolution changed our relationship with time. Everything serves work from which we derive all life meaning. Leisure redefined to serve the purpose of improving work productivity. Everything redefined as serving some future goal instead of living in the moment. Hobbies with no end goal are purest form of leisure because it's done for its own sake. Solving problems is life's meaning. Take the time, don't rush to a solution. Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality, stay on the bus. Having time and freedom is meaningless if not synchronized with other people. Loneliness of the digital nomad. Cosmic Insignificance Therapy. Overvaluing your existence sets the bar too high. Nothing we do matters on a cosmic scale. Nobody cares what you do with your life other than you.)

- _**Meditations**_ by Marcus Aurelius (B – The source of a lot of modern day wisdom and philosophy. Nice to read before bed.)

- _**Snow Crash**_ by Neal Stephenson (B – Fun at times, but unfulfilling at the end.)

- _**The Almanack of Naval Ravikant**_ by Eric Jorgenson (A – Ravikant is a great thinker across disciplines. I love that he recommends reading original science texts like Adam Smith, Charles Darwin.)

- _**The Wealth Ladder**_ by Nick Magguilli (A – defines the 6 levels of wealth and how to get from one to next, why the strategy that works to climb from e.g. L3 to L4 doesn't work for getting from L4 to L5. High income jobs never get you past L4. L5, L6 requires equity in a busines. Pairs well with How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis)

- _**Fossil Future**_ by Alex Epstein (A+ — completely changed my mind about fossil fuels and man-made climate change by helping me realize the absurdity of the anti-impact moral framework, when we should instead be operating on the human flourishing framework. Everyone should read this book.)
- _**The Dip**_ by Seth Godin (A — excellent call to action re: quitting, when to do and when not to. Ignores question of what success means however, also I think lacks a benefit-risk analysis in terms of personal wealth i.e. rich people can afford to take more shots)
- _**The Road Less Traveled**_ by Scott Peck (A — the first sections about self-discipline and love are brilliant, subsequent sections on religion etc. less developed and outdated)
- _**Modern Poker Theory**_ by Michael Acevedo (Didn't finish, interesting but too technical)
- _**The Blank Slate**_ by Steven Pinker (Didn't finish, not bad just no longer groundbreaking ideas as the world has already adopted this viewpoint about human nature, and Pinker's arguments are long and exhausting)
