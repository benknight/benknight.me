- _**Snow Crash**_ by Neal Stephenson
- _**Four Thousdand Weeks**_ by Oliver Burkeman

---

### 2025

- _**The Almanack of Naval Ravikant**_ by Eric Jorgenson (A – Ravikant is a great thinker across disciplines. I love that he recommends reading original science texts like Adam Smith, Charles Darwin.)

- _**The Wealth Ladder**_ by Nick Magguilli (A – defines the 6 levels of wealth and how to get from one to next, why the strategy that works to climb from e.g. L3 to L4 doesn't work for getting from L4 to L5. High income jobs never get you past L4. L5, L6 requires equity in a busines. Pairs well with How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis)

- _**Fossil Future**_ by Alex Epstein (A+ — completely changed my mind about fossil fuels and man-made climate change by helping me realize the absurdity of the anti-impact moral framework, when we should instead be operating on the human flourishing framework. Everyone should read this book.)
- _**The Dip**_ by Seth Godin (A — excellent call to action re: quitting, when to do and when not to. Ignores question of what success means however, also I think lacks a benefit-risk analysis in terms of personal wealth i.e. rich people can afford to take more shots)
- _**The Road Less Traveled**_ by Scott Peck (A — the first sections about self-discipline and love are brilliant, subsequent sections on religion etc. less developed and outdated)
- _**Modern Poker Theory**_ by Michael Acevedo (Didn't finish, interesting but too technical)
- _**The Blank Slate**_ by Steven Pinker (Didn't finish, not bad just no longer groundbreaking ideas as the world has already adopted this viewpoint about human nature, and Pinker's arguments are long and exhausting)
- _**Happy Money**_ by Ken Honda (Didn't finish, not interesting)
- _**Awareness**_ by Anthony De Mello (A+)
- _**Things Become Other Things**_ by Craig Mod (A-)
- _**Train Dreams**_ by Denis Johnson (B)
- _**Pilgrim at Tinker Creek**_ by Annie Dillard (Didn't finish, not my style)
- _**Atomic Habits**_ by James Clear (A)
- _**You Can Negotiate Anything**_ by Herb Cohen (C — too many anecdotes, kind of outdated)
