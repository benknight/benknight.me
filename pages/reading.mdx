### What I'm reading now

- _**Black Swan**_ by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

---

### 2026

- _**The Origin of Species**_ by Charles Darwin (How much I recommend it: 9/10 – Read only some key chapters out of desire to read original sources as recommended by Ravikant. Fascinating to read Darwin's own words explaining how Natural Selection works before DNA was even discovered.)

- _**Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow**_ by Gabrielle Zevin (How much I recommend it: 9/10 – I rarely read fiction but I could hardly put this one down. Probably one of the best modern novels.)

### 2025

- _**Sum**_ by David Eagleman (How much I recommend it: 7/10)

- _**The Miracle of Mindfulness**_ by Thich Nhat Hanh (How much I recommend it: 6/10 - good bedtime read. We should always be in a state of mindfulness which means awareness about what is happening in the present moment. Meditation is a way of practicing mindfulness. The breath is how we can bring ourselves back into awareness. Washing the dishes for the sake of washing the dishes, not rushing to finish. Remaining in a state of awareness even during conversation.)

- _**Breath**_ by James Nestor (How much I recommend it: 5/10 things everyone should know about breathing which, like the gut, is an easily overlooked cornerstone of health. Basic takeaways: always breathe through your nose, most people breathe too much. 5.5 breaths per minute at 5.5s inhale and exhale. Chewing important for opening the airways. Increasing CO2 tolerance is key for athletic performance. Some parts feel like borderline pseudoscience however, and the book has too much story and narrative that not relevant to the content)

- _**The Coddling of the American Mind**_ by Jonathan Haidt (How much I recommend it: 6/10 – some alternative titles could be "Why Gen Z is so fucked up (social media)" or "How the political left went off the deep end". I skimmed most of it since the ideas it proposed have been widely accepted and disseminated by other podcasters/authors like Mark Manson. The best part is the 3 great untruths which explain a lot of the social media fueled craziness that started happening in Western democracies in the mid 2010s which I definitely felt while living in SF and ultimate pushed me to be more centrist and anti-political. Also one if the reasons it was a relief to move to Southeast Asia where the mind virus hadn't taken hold.)

- _**The Psychology of Money**_ by Morgan Housel (How much I recommend it: 4/10 - an amalgamation of modern personal finance advice and human psychology. If you've read Daniel Kahneman and Ramit Sethi, you've already got the gist of how these two topics intersect. Enjoyable read but didn't learn anything new.)
- _**Four Thousand Weeks**_ by Oliver Burkeman (How much I recommend it: 9/10 — Humanity's futile relationship with time and misunderstanding of it as being a resource we have. We "are" time. Failure to use our time well is rooted in fear of confronting our limitations/our death. Distractions give us a way out. They are not the cause, just where we go. Nowadays distractions are readily available via technology, but urge to avoid reality is universal human nature. Commitment as a strategy to spend time on what matters. Industrial revolution changed our relationship with time. Everything serves work from which we derive all life meaning. Leisure redefined to serve the purpose of improving work productivity. Everything redefined as serving some future goal instead of living in the moment. Hobbies with no end goal are purest form of leisure because it's done for its own sake. Solving problems is life's meaning. Take the time, don't rush to a solution. Originality lies on the far side of unoriginality, stay on the bus. Having time and freedom is meaningless if not synchronized with other people. Loneliness of the digital nomad. Cosmic Insignificance Therapy. Overvaluing your existence sets the bar too high. Nothing we do matters on a cosmic scale. Nobody cares what you do with your life other than you.)

- _**Meditations**_ by Marcus Aurelius (How much I recommend it: 6/10 – The source of a lot of modern day wisdom and philosophy. Nice to read before bed.)

- _**Snow Crash**_ by Neal Stephenson (How much I recommend it: 6/10 – Fun at times, but unfulfilling at the end.)

- _**The Almanack of Naval Ravikant**_ by Eric Jorgenson (How much I recommend it: 9/10 – Ravikant is a great thinker across disciplines. I love that he recommends reading original science texts like Adam Smith, Charles Darwin.)

- _**The Wealth Ladder**_ by Nick Magguilli (How much I recommend it: 9/10 – defines the 6 levels of wealth and how to get from one to next, why the strategy that works to climb from e.g. L3 to L4 doesn't work for getting from L4 to L5. High income jobs never get you past L4. L5, L6 requires equity in a busines. Pairs well with How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis)

- _**Fossil Future**_ by Alex Epstein (How much I recommend it: 10/10 — completely changed my mind about fossil fuels and man-made climate change by helping me realize the absurdity of the anti-impact moral framework, when we should instead be operating on the human flourishing framework. Everyone should read this book.)
- _**The Dip**_ by Seth Godin (How much I recommend it: 9/10 — excellent call to action re: quitting, when to do and when not to. Ignores question of what success means however, also I think lacks a benefit-risk analysis in terms of personal wealth i.e. rich people can afford to take more shots)
- _**The Road Less Traveled**_ by Scott Peck (How much I recommend it: 9/10 — the first sections about self-discipline and love are brilliant, subsequent sections on religion etc. less developed and outdated)
- _**Modern Poker Theory**_ by Michael Acevedo (Didn't finish, interesting but too technical)
- _**The Blank Slate**_ by Steven Pinker (Didn't finish, not bad just no longer groundbreaking ideas as the world has already adopted this viewpoint about human nature, and Pinker's arguments are long and exhausting)
- _**Happy Money**_ by Ken Honda (Didn't finish, not interesting)
- _**Awareness**_ by Anthony De Mello (How much I recommend it: 10/10)
- _**Things Become Other Things**_ by Craig Mod (How much I recommend it: 8/10)
- _**Train Dreams**_ by Denis Johnson (How much I recommend it: 6/10)
- _**Pilgrim at Tinker Creek**_ by Annie Dillard (Didn't finish, not my style)
- _**Atomic Habits**_ by James Clear (How much I recommend it: 9/10)
- _**You Can Negotiate Anything**_ by Herb Cohen (How much I recommend it: 4/10 — too many anecdotes, kind of outdated)
- _**The Swerve**_ by Stephen Greenblatt (How much I recommend it: 7/10)
- _**How to Win Friends and Influence People**_ by Dale Carnegie (How much I recommend it: 9/10)

### 2020

- _**Thinking Fast & Slow**_ by Daniel Kahneman (How much I recommend it: 10/10)
- _**Fiber Fueled**_ by Will Bulsiewicz (How much I recommend it: 7/10 sums up why microbiome is cornerstone of health, and therefore eat more fiber with maximum diversity. Unfortunately also argues for complete veganism based on more flimsy evidence)
