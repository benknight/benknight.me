Hi there, I’m Ben. I’m a web developer/designer with 10+ years of experience in consumer-facing tech, including scrappy startups and some Big Tech™️. I love to bridge the gap between design and engineering and I pride myself on building high-quality end-user experiences. I enjoy making creative decisions and usually fill a hybrid designer/developer role.
